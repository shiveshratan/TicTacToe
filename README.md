  This is a famous TicTacToe game. The game is played on a grid that is a 3 * 3 Matrix.
  At First it takes name of both the Player then Player 1 will enter X and Player 2 will enter O.
  Each Player takes turns by putting their marks in empty squares. 
  The first player to get 3 marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner and that player
  name will displayed on the screen with a message.
  And Game wiil be over.
  I used JAVA to develop this Game.
